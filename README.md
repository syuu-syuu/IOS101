### App Idea: Family Entertainment Scheduler
In my childhood, television programs were listed in the newspaper, and my family and I would plan our weekly TV schedule based on this information. Today, we have access to tons of entertainment resources such as videos, music, and live streams, available anytime and anywhere. However, I still miss the feeling of planning upcoming shows to watch together with my family. Therefore, I wish to create an app that brings back this experience. This app would allow users to form family groups, add entertainment content they wish to watch along with corresponding resource links, and schedule these viewings. Additionally, the app would push recommendations for content based on various media resources that the users might find interesting. The goal is to foster a shared entertainment planning experience, bringing families and friends closer in the digital age.
